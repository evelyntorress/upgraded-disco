# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

The goal of this assignment it is to modify the starter code to make the application work, it is a Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
On the back end, the application should include a `db.json` file that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. My job is build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
